        "generated_text": "In his work \"Humanism: A New Religion,\" Dewey argued that Humanism could serve as a unifying force for society, providing a common set of values and principles that could bring people together and inspire them to work towards a better future. He believed that Humanism, with its emphasis on human agency, democracy, and the pursuit of happiness, could provide a sense of purpose and meaning that was lacking in traditional religious belief systems.  Dewey's use of the term \"common faith\" to describe Humanism highlights the idea that this belief system is not just a set of abstract principles, but a shared commitment to a way of life that is based on human values and experiences. By framing Humanism as a \"religion\" in this sense, Dewey was able to emphasize its importance and relevance in contemporary society, and to encourage people to embrace it as a guiding force in their lives.  Overall, Dewey's relation of \"per:religion\" with the object \"Humanism\" reflects his belief that Humanism has the potential to provide a sense of purpose and meaning that is similar to what is provided by traditional religious belief systems, but without the dogmatic or supernatural elements that are often associated with religion. By framing Humanism in this way, Dewey was able to emphasize its importance and relevance in contemporary society, and to encourage people to embrace it as a guiding force in their lives."

The organization's charter, for example, states that the MNLF's goal is to \"establish an independent Islamic state in the southern Philippines, based on the principles of Islam and the rights of the Bangsamoro people to self-determination.\"  Furthermore, the MNLF's leadership and membership are predominantly Muslim, and the organization has been supported by Muslim communities in the southern Philippines and abroad. The MNLF's struggle for self-determination is therefore not only a political struggle, but also a religious one, as it seeks to establish an Islamic state based on Islamic principles and values.  In the context of the peace agreement signed in September 1996, the MNLF's political and religious affiliation with Muslims is significant because it highlights the importance of addressing the religious and political grievances of the Muslim minority in the southern Philippines.

In contrast, Patty Murray in Washington is also struggling to keep her seat, but the relation \"per:stateorprovinces_of_residence\" between Patty Murray and Washington is not as direct as it is between Barbara Boxer and California.
